[Example code for plotting orientations](https://github.com/davenquinn/Van-Horn-orientations/blob/master/compute-orientations.py)

From Nathan:

  Ideally as you said we would group by translucence like in Fig 8A (below).
  That should work to our advantage because the darker ellipses should be
  smaller. I also added a column with the outcrop descriptions from B. IO
  = intact outcrop, IOC = intact outcrop on contact, B = individual blocks, OL
  = outcrop on ledge. Depending on how the first plot looks, it would be nice
  to recreate 8B as well with ellipses, but we could always banish it to the
  supplement since it isn't that integral to the paper.
